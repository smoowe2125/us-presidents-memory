# us-presidents-memory
us-presidents-memory is a simple memory game written in C++ using SDL2 where under the cards
lie US presidents. For some reason when I first thought about a game like this the idea seemed
funny as hell. To run this game clone this repo and run the executables. .exe for windows and no
file extension for linux. There is a bug in this game but I don't know how to fix it. You will encounter it
100%.
